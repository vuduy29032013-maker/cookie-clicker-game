🎮 My Small Indie Clicker Game Project (Early Development)

This is a small personal project that I’m developing in my free time. It’s a simple browser-based clicker game, created mainly for learning, experimenting, and having fun with game mechanics.

The goal of this project is not perfection, but growth — both for the game and for me as a developer. If you enjoy small clicker games, experimental mechanics, or testing early-stage projects, you might enjoy trying it out
