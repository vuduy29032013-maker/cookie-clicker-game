🎮 My Small Indie Clicker Game Project (Early Development)

This is a small personal project that I’m developing in my free time. It’s a simple browser-based clicker game, created mainly for learning, experimenting, and having fun with game mechanics.

The game is intentionally lightweight and easy to access. There is no download, no installation, and no account required — you can simply open the website and start playing. The core gameplay is based on clicking, upgrading, and watching numbers slowly grow over time.

This project is not meant to be a large or professional game. It’s a small indie experiment, where I try ideas, test mechanics, and learn through trial and error. Because of that, the game is constantly changing and evolving.

⚠️ Important Notice
This game is still in an early stage of development and contains many bugs, glitches, and unfinished features. Some parts of the game may behave incorrectly, balance may feel broken, and prog

I’m fully aware of these problems, and improving them is part of the learning process. Anyone who plays the game should consider themselves a tester rather than a regular player. Feedback, bug reports, and suggestions are extremely valuable and help me improve the

The goal of this project is not perfection, but growth — both for the game and for me as a developer. If you enjoy small clicker games, experimental mechanics, or testing early-stage projects, you might enjoy trying it out

If you’re looking for a polished, bug-free experience, this project may not be suitable yet. But if you’re curious, patient, and interested in seeing how a small game develops over time, feel free to give it a try.
Advanced Game Systems
🔮 Weather System

One of the most unique features of the game is its dynamic weather system, which introduces dozens of different weather events such as:

Rain, Wind, Thunderstorm

Meteor Showers, Diamond Rain, Acid Rain

Cosmic, Secret, and Admin-only weather events

Each weather type comes with:

Unique visuals and animations

Timed effects

Thematic colors and UI styling

This system adds variety, atmosphere, and strategic depth to the gameplay.

🥚 Egg & Pet (Gacha) System

Inspired by popular idle and Roblox-style games, the egg system allows players to:

Purchase eggs using in-game currency

Hatch pets with animated hatch sequences

View detailed drop rates (Common → Rare → Epic → Legendary)

Collect, equip, and manage pets

Pets provide multipliers and bonuses, and players can equip multiple pets at once using limited slots, encouraging collection and optimization.

🎟 Game Pass System

The game includes a fully styled Game Pass Shop, featuring special passes such as:

Super Pass (LIMITED)

Infinity Pass (TRANSCENDENT)

Quantum Pass (HOT)

Cosmic Pass (BEST FOR YOU)

Each game pass offers powerful bonuses like:

Massive starting currency

Cooldown removal

Increased auto-click speed

Higher multipliers and click power

Visually, these passes stand out with:

Animated glow effects

Pulsing borders

Rainbow gradients

Floating labels (LIMITED, HOT, TRANSCENDENT, etc.)

This system mirrors real-world monetization UI while remaining purely experimental and educational.

Admin & Debug Tools

For testing and development purposes, the game includes an Admin Panel that allows:

Manual currency injection

Weather control

Debug actions

Rapid feature testing

This panel functions like an in-game developer console and demonstrates how live game control systems can be implemented in-browser.

Save, Load & Persistence

Players can:

Save progress locally

Load saved game states

Export and import save files

This ensures long-term progression and replayability without requiring a backend or server connection.

Mobile-First Optimization

A major focus of this project is mobile usability. The game includes:

Complete zoom prevention (anti double-tap zoom)

Touch-optimized buttons (minimum 44px touch targets)

Disabled hover effects on touch devices

Responsive layouts for phones and tablets

Safe-area support for notched devices

The result is a smooth and consistent experience across desktop and mobile browsers.

Visual Design & UI

The UI emphasizes:

High-contrast gradients

Animated buttons and panels

Smooth transitions and feedback

Clear visual hierarchy

Every system is visually distinct, making the game feel lively and polished despite being a single HTML file.

Technical Highlights

Built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

No external libraries or frameworks

Single-file architecture

Extensive use of CSS animations and responsive design

Modular system design within one file

Conclusion

Cookie Clicker Game is more than a simple clicker—it is a feature-packed idle game prototype showcasing advanced UI design, game system layering, and mobile optimization using only core web technologies.

This project demonstrates how far a browser-based game can be pushed without external dependencies, making it an ideal showcase for experimentation, learning, and creative game design.
